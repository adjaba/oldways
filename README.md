 Please view visualization here: https://github.mit.edu/pages/6894-sp20/FP-Oldways-Data-Visualization/
 
 The work was split among group members in the following way:
 
 ## Mattie
 * Generating Dummy Data for the purpose of visualization
 * Green, Yellow, Red Dot Student Distribution Summary Panel
 * Warning Sign on categories that need to be observed
 * Communicating with Oldways Organization


 ## Andrea
 * Creating cards for each category
 * Generating statistics for Data on front side of the card
 * Flipping effect of individual cards
 * Graphs for the backside of the card
 
 
## Haripriya
* Loading Page, Page Layout & Images
* Filtering 
* Tabs for Different Categories 
* Channeling Data to backside of the card and Horizontal Navigation Dots

## Development Process

We had been working with a nutrition non-profit, Oldways, that holds cooking classes teaching students to be healthier. Oldways had data through these surveys from teachers and students to see how each class is going and how students have improved over the duration of the class. They wanted us to create a data visualization tool to generate statistics and graphs using this data such that


They also want to be able to group their data in various categories such as by class, by teacher, and by year to generate more summary statistics. We envision a tool which would initially display high level statistics that are averaged across all classes for all years and then the user would be able to filter within these statistics to get a lower level breakdown. Additionally, we would add in markers that point the user to look at certain noteworthy things in the data (for example, if a certain class is struggling, it would suggest that the user looks at the Class A taught by Teacher A in Year 2019) and then it would produce visualizations for this and help the user explore the data.
